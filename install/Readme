See BuildEM for more information...

Requirements:

C/C++ and fortran compilers
libcurl and https support (note that these components are usually present in standard OS builds but may need to be installed explicitly)
git
CMake 2.8.6+
python 2.6+ if patches or templates are used in build process. In future, we could require a python build from source and use that instead or switch to a platform-independent patch/template system built into CMake.
Note that a different version of python can be built from source. Buildem does not try to minimize overall build time by reusing pre-compiled packages. The presence of multiple compiler versions across the different Fedora/RHEL versions and our very heterogeneous workstation environment requires developer attention and tracking of installs across multiple machines.
CPU Throttling must be disabled to build atlas, a dependency of numpy (/usr/bin/cpufreq-selector -g performance).

The build process at /path/to/foo/code (use absolute paths):

% mkdir foo-build; cd foo-build
% cmake -D BUILDEM_DIR=/path/to/BPD  /path/to/foo/code
% make
If this is the first time an application was compiled for this BPD, the build script will download the buildem repo into the BPD and the user will be prompted to re-run the cmake and make steps as above. In this initial case, the build process would be:

% mkdir foo-build; cd foo-build
% cmake -D BUILDEM_DIR=/path/to/BPD  /path/to/foo/code
% make
% cmake -D BUILDEM_DIR=/path/to/BPD  /path/to/foo/code
% make

Header files will be copied to /path/to/BPD/include, libraries will be copied to /path/to/BPD/lib and vigranumy will be copied to /path/to/BPD/lib/python2.7/site-packages. 

The script /path/to/BPD/bin/vigra-config gives information about flags when compiling with vigra.
